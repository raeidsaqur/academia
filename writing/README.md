What are some Resources people can look at?

These are focused on CHI (Computer Human Interaction) but many of the lessons can/will generalize! Please also add resources from other fields!
>As people read through these resources, can they add comments with more information about *why* something is helpful, or just copy/paste snippets from the paper. Why? This helps people know where to start so they're not so overwhelmed, and also can prioritize.
