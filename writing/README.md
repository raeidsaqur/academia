### Notes from Sep 2, 2020 Grad Metaskills with IAI lab

Google doc for the [meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUqpnc2fEwoOHaz1-mvnBdUolb6ps_CexbCZt2aq9NY/edit#)

*(Distilled) Personal Suggestions:*
- Take audience PoV: the biggest problem is forgetting you know more than the audience. 
- Adhere to these 4 principles of 'good writing' (these transcends all writing verticals): *Simplicity, Clarity, Brevity and Humanity*. 
- Get reviews/feedback from peers on excerpts (don't wait for the polished version)
	- Problems: 
	    - Reluctance/vulnerability in showing unfinished work
	    - Fear that somebody will trash your idea/paper (or worse, judge your intellect), subsequent confidence loss ...   
	- Solutions: 
	    - Get over it. Build a network/group of peers/collaborators you feel comfortable w/ in doing this. 
	    - Exposure will alleviate the discomfort over time. 
	    - __Don't take life 'too' seriously__. This is too pervasive in academia (outsider perspective): the fear of being judged _'not smart or intelligent'_. Who gives a sh$t? In the long run, we are all dead (Keynes). Really, you are not that important (unless you are Carl Friedrich Gauss, Godel, Ramanujan et al. esque talent - if true, stop reading this immediately), and neither are those trashing you ideas  
- Use `fake deadlines' and write versions.

*What are some Resources people can look at?*

These are focused on CHI (Computer Human Interaction) but many of the lessons can/will generalize! Please also add resources from other fields!
